# 3awalem 2 Human Translator


3awalem 2 Human translator is a Chrome Extension I hacked together during a weekend
that allows users to de-obfuscate arabic text written in an old technique referred to
as "3awalem".

This project is just for fun, *AND DEFINITELY NOT A PORTOFOLIO ITEM*.



Since I suck at JS, contributions are welcome :D
